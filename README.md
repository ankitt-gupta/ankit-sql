# Learning Strategy (SQL & PL/SQL):

### Start with SQL Fundamentals:

Basic Queries: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY.
Filtering: AND, OR, NOT, LIKE, IN, BETWEEN.
Aggregates: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, GROUP BY, HAVING.
Joins: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN. This is crucial!
Subqueries: IN, EXISTS, correlated subqueries.
DDL (Data Definition Language): CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE.
DML (Data Manipulation Language): INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

### Practice Extensively:

Online Platforms: Use platforms like HackerRank, LeetCode, SQL Zoo, or Stratascratch. These provide problems and an environment to test your SQL.
Your Local Database: Create your own tables, insert sample data, and then write queries against them. This hands-on approach is the most effective.
Idea: Design a simple database schema for a library, an online store, or a student management system. Then write SQL to manage it.
Move to PL/SQL:

### Once you're comfortable with SQL, start with PL/SQL.

Basics: Anonymous blocks (DECLARE...BEGIN...END;), variables, IF/ELSE, loops (LOOP, WHILE, FOR).
Cursors: Explicit and implicit cursors for row-by-row processing.
Stored Procedures and Functions: Creating reusable code blocks.
Packages: Organizing related procedures, functions, and variables into logical units.
Error Handling: EXCEPTION blocks.
Triggers: Automating actions based on DML events.

### Structured Learning Resources:

Oracle Documentation: The official source. It's comprehensive but can be dense.
Online Courses: Udemy, Coursera, LinkedIn Learning often have good SQL and PL/SQL courses.
YouTube Tutorials: Many channels offer free lessons.
Books: Look for highly-rated books on SQL and PL/SQL (e.g., "SQL Fundamentals" or "Oracle PL/SQL Programming" by Steven Feuerstein).
